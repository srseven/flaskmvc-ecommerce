# flaskmvc-ecommerce
An extensive ecommerce website with a Python Flask framework and Oracle Database 11g backend and an HTML5, CSS3 (Bootstrap) and JavaScript (jQuery) frontend based on Model View Controller (MVC) pattern. This was made as a semester project of my Database Systems (DB) and Object Oriented Analysis and Design (OOAD) courses. This project is work in-progress and can be used as an extensive boilerplate when starting out an ecommerce website with Flask.

# Dependencies:
These are packages the project is built upon. I suggest first creating a `virtualenv` and then installing these packages inside it to avoid version conflicts with global Python package installs.
